# Scaling Prometheus and Loki with Grafana Enterprise Metrics and Grafana Enterprise Logs - Workshop by Grafana Labs

This repository contains the hands-on / lab exercise instructions for the Grafana Labs workshop on Scaling Prometheus and Loki with Grafana Enterprise Metrics and Grafana Enterprise Logs.

The instructions assume you are attending an instance of that workshop and a Grafana Labs employee has prepped the GEM and GEL environment for you. If not, these steps will **very likely not work** on their own.

Prerequisites:
- You have signed up for a free Grafana Cloud account at https://grafana.com/signup
- You can [log into your personal Grafana instance](https://grafana.com/login) as an admin
- You have the ability to install the [Grafana Agent](https://github.com/grafana/agent) on either your local machine or some machine that can send metrics & log data to an external endpoint on the internet

**_Why do I need to sign up for a Grafana Cloud account if the workshop is focused on the self-hosted/on-prem Grafana offerings?_**

This is purely for convenience / ease of setup. Grafana Cloud offers you a totally free Grafana instance so this saves a lot of time and gives you a playground to use after the workshop.

There is nothing in this workshop that explicitly requires you to use Grafana Cloud, you could use a self-hosted Grafana instance with internet access and get through all of the exercises just the same.

**Note:** The administrative functions of Grafana Enterprise Metrics and Grafana Enterprise Logs do require Grafana Enterprise, but attendees are not directly accessing those functions in the workshop. Your workshop lead will be doing that.
